Liri Node App

In this assignment, I made LIRI. LIRI is like iPhone's SIRI. However, LIRI is a Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI will be a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data.

Type into the command line:
1. node liri.js spotify-this-song <song name> to get your desired song's information.
2. node liri.js my-tweets to see my last 20 tweets.
3. node liri.js movie-this <movie name> to discover your movie's stats.
4. node liri.js do-it-this-way to see a surprise song.
